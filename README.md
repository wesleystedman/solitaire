# Klondike Solitaire

Klondike is the most popular and well known form of solitaire in the US and Canada.  It's named after the Klondike region of the Yukon territory of Canada, famous for a late 1890s gold rush, where prospectors may have created or popularized the game.  

Klondike solitaire is played with a standard deck of 52 cards.  Cards are dealt face-down to the _tableau_ in seven piles of one through seven cards, then the top card of each pile is turned face-up.  The remaining 24 cards form the _stock_.  

Once play begins, cards may be dealt from the _stock_ to the _waste_, most commonly one or three cards at a time.  If the _stock_ is empty, the _waste_ is flipped over to form a new _stock_.  Some rulesets may limit the number of times this can happen.

Cards may be moved from the _waste_ to the _tableau_, between piles on the _tableau_, or from the _foundation_ to the _tableau_, so long as the cards are of descending rank and opposite color suits.

Cards may also be moved one at a time from the _waste_ or _tableau_ to the _foundation_ if they are of the same suit and ascending rank.

The game is won when all 52 cards have been moved to the _foundation_.  The game is lost if no more moves can be made to advance the game state.
